# Simon
 Group Project 1
This is a version of the Simon game. It works by producing a random sequence of colors and sounds which the player must then replicate by clicking on the appropriate colors. Every time the player replicates the sequence correctly, the sequence increases by one. The game continues until the user makes a mistake.

To begin playing, open the simon_project.mlapp file in MATLAB. Make sure that the current directory is set to the 'Simon' folder in MATLAB before proceeding (this can be done by typing cd Simon in the Command Window). Press the green Run button in MATLAB. To start playing, press the Simon 1.0 button. The game will launch and a sequence will be generated. When the color flash and sound conclude, replicate the sequence by pressing the corresponding color on the screen. If correct, the game will proceed forward.
To end the game, press the Quit button or intentionally make a mistake in repeating the sequence. Your high score will be displayed in the 'Score:' window.
